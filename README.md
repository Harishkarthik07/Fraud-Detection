Workflow

Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values and normalized numerical data.
Performed EDA to uncover patterns.

Model Development:
Used Logistic Regression for prediction.
Evaluated performance using AUC-ROC, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

Insights:
Identified key features influencing fraud.
Set thresholds for flagging suspicious transactions.

Action Plan:
Implement the model for real-time fraud detection.
Prioritize flagged transactions for review.
